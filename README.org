* Dotfiles
  My dotfiles, a masterpiece in progress.
** Stow
   =stow= is a software package installation manager. When a file or directory
   is stowed, a symbolic link is created and lives where other programs expect
   it to be. However, I can manage these files and directories in one
   location, which is easier for me. If you haven't heard of =stow= already,
   check out the manpage, or check out an article [[http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html?round=two][here]]!
** Email
   Trying out =mu= and =mu4e= to check email in emacs, all supporting files can
   be found in =/email=. Requires a python package to be installed, for Fedora
   its =gnome-python2-gnomekeyring=.

   To add username and password to keyring
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   python mail/.offlineimap.py $REPO $USERNAME
   #+END_SRC
